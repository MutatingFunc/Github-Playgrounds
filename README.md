# Github-Playgrounds
Test project for the Github API

## Setup

Add your personal access token:
`Github Playgrounds/Packages/Sources/GithubAPI/Resources/Access Token.txt`

## Considerations

This project uses the Swift Composable Architecture and Snapshot Testing frameworks by Pointfree.

Snapshot tests simulate a variety of devices sizes, but due to subtle differences must run on iPhone 15.
